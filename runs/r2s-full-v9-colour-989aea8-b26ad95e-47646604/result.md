**Hypothesis.** Trained on the 2,681 family-disjoint training icons with metric coordinates, path-major order, online exact augmentation and compositions, the 9.0M-parameter render-to-program model transcribes held-out validation renders better than retrieving the closest training icon. Pass requires all three: (1) mean 72 px pixel error below the nearest-training-icon baseline with the paired 95% interval on the reduction excluding zero; (2) CLIP top-1 on Gate N's 32 validation icons at or above OmniSVG 4B zero-shot, 0.609; (3) median single-icon latency on the RTX 4080 under 500 ms.

Latency covers encoding and decoding to a validated token program; it excludes
rasterising the SVG. Samples: `samples.png`, rows are reference, model, nearest
training icon.
